# ScrapedDotaGuides

Tired of streamlined builds? Want to see many item recommendations from the pros for the newest patch?  
Then you're in luck, this project scrapes what [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com) has to offer in `opendota.com/heroes/<hero_id>/items` and aims to replace *pretty* outdated default guides in `..\dota 2 beta\game\dota\itembuilds`.

How to use?

1. Replace the mentioned folder with the one from the release or run the main script yourself and replace.
   1. Use `pip install -r requirements` to meet the requirements.
2. Select the default guide
3. Have fun!

TODO:

- [ ] Create a function that automatically builds `constants/items.csv` by accessing vpk and inject flags from another csv
