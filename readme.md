Tired of streamlined, opinionated and slowly updating guides? Want to see many item recommendations from the pros for the newest patch?

Then you're in luck, this project uses what [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com) has to offer in in their [API](https://docs.opendota.com) and replaces *pretty* outdated and useless default guides in `..<dota_install_path>/game/dota/itembuilds`.

## How to install?

### Running [autoReplace](scripts/autoReplace.py)

You can run this script whenever you like, it'll ask once for your itembuild path.

#### Doing it automatically

Put the script somewhere you like, create a task to run the command  
`python <path-of-your-choosing>/autoReplace.py`  
every day at ~2AM.  
> [!NOTE]
> Run it first to input your itembuild path.

## [Minify](https://github.com/Egezenn/dota2-minify)

You can check the option `OpenDotaGuides Guides` here.

### Manually

1. You can find the Dota2 installation path by going into `Steam` \> `Library` \> right click on `Dota 2` \> `Manage` \> `Browse Local Files`
2. Then go into `game` \> `dota`
3. Replace the `itembuilds` directory's contents with
    1. the contents of [release](https://github.com/Egezenn/OpenDotaGuides/releases/latest)
    2. the contents of your local run. Refer to [here](#local-compilation).
4. Select the default guide in game
5. Have fun!

> [!TIP]
> If you've modified the contents of the folder while you were in Dota and in a match, disconnect & reconnect to see the changes.

## Local compilation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need python(~=3.13) and git installed:

First instruction set is for Windows, second is for Linux.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Egezenn/OpenDotaGuides.git`
2. `cd OpenDotaGuides`
3. `python -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the python virtual environment:
   1. `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
   2. `source .venv/Scripts/activate`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `python -m odg` `-v -r -c -s` `-h`
7. If the dota installation isn't detected
    1. Remove `itembuilds` folder from Dota2:
        1. `rmdir <dota_install_path>\dota 2 beta\game\dota\itembuilds`
        2. `rm -r <dota_install_path>/dota 2 beta/game/dota/itembuilds`
    2. Move newly created guides:
        1. `move .\itembuilds <dota_install_path>\game\dota\itembuilds`
        2. `mv ./itembuilds <dota_install_path>/game/dota/itembuilds`
